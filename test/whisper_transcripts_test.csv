MSP-PODCAST_test3_0567.wav, couple weeks ago riding in my car and a Luther Vandross song came on.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0568.wav, this list and then watch this whole Julia Child show and I don't have I don't have time

MSP-PODCAST_test3_0573.wav, the actual music business in
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0574.wav, They've never imagined an alternative to a public school or to a government taxi.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0575.wav," God, you're the lazy man. And I was like, wow,"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0576.wav," I love it. But the pettier part that people don't remember is that he had that settlement a few years back where one, his next two album sales"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0577.wav," like, uh-uh. But Mr. West, he's out there. He's the life of the party. He's the hostess with the mostess."
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0578.wav, They banned blue jeans and Marlboro cigarettes.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0579.wav, sort of skeezy and comfortable with this kind of self-promotion that most of us aren't. If I

MSP-PODCAST_test3_0581.wav, had lost children. At least I didn't know about it.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0582.wav," out last night and someone saw me on the street and said, Oh my"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0583.wav," the window, you would do things like lower the information costs to voters to"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0584.wav, bias you know i think just everything that's happening with all the terrorism and things
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0585.wav," You know, that's I think I think part of the problem arises because people just fight."
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0586.wav," Also, what are they looking at on your cell phone? Like, they don't have time to go through all your personal information, you know?"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0587.wav," Flying in airports, getting to places is a mess right now."
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0588.wav, It is largely because I know that I'm not supposed to be there.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0589.wav, I just don't trust a stranger.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0590.wav," man, an elderly man, or any type of man, to go into a woman's bathroom when there's potentially children in there."
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0591.wav, But it is an interesting idea to just think that maybe just to have huge bathrooms.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0592.wav, the toilet and there's other people in the stalls next to me. That just makes me uncomfortable. Yeah.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0593.wav," because he's got a dad, but I just need to know"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0594.wav, I like a guy to sound a certain way.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0595.wav," So if I could give anyone any advice, it would be to understand who your true and authentic self is, what"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0596.wav, you can't really have that.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0597.wav, I'm gonna start with Jess actually.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0598.wav," week or so, is Mr. Dilemma Reeves. So that's the reason why it's going to be a very, very special podcast today, because we are going to essentially go through Ravi's"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0599.wav," I would say for me, the first thing is being vulnerable."
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0600.wav, and you need to build your boost so whether it's looks whether it's
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0601.wav," The platforms, to be fair, that I've been seeing a lot of those messages are platforms that are known to tension people to"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0602.wav, I think that the strap line that Jim Sharp created
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0603.wav," But bearing in mind that she has, like, we..."
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0604.wav, Sometimes we try and put ourselves in situations that don't make sense and we try and force it because we feel like love will push us through.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0605.wav," But like, I do think the ones that aren't even trying to be trash or aren't even got like,"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0606.wav," Interestingly, what are your intentions with this woman? Are you looking for a bit of fun or do you actually want a relationship? And that will determine what"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0607.wav," And like, what would you say has been a highlight for you with COVID?"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0608.wav," I've said this a couple of times, for me, like planning was really important."
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0609.wav, you probably might not chase her as well.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0610.wav, I just realized these are the attributes that I wanted to see.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0611.wav, example um you're a different person when you're sad you're a different person when
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0612.wav," I was thinking, where was that information? Like, why can't I"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0613.wav, think okay yeah I can I can be in a future with this person if that makes sense
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0614.wav, This dating we're doing is dating for kids and dating
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0615.wav," it gets to that point where you think that specifically, because I mean,"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0616.wav," if she was at the time when they started it, she was 28, let's say she started"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0617.wav," know, like really like digging deep, like finding exercises. Like I would research, um,"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0618.wav," as much as people say they hate the talking stage,"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0619.wav," I've got arthritis. And when you say arthritis, I know a lot of people go straight to the obvious one, which is osteoarthritis, which is"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0620.wav, gently though but he was just like oh like what kind of arthritis is it
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0621.wav," I, yeah, definitely. I don't think there is a,"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0622.wav," I hear you kind of mention the fact that in your company, that was one, you know, you were the first person that really went through that process. It's still a surprise because it's like,"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0623.wav," I've been held in the kitchen. So for me, it's like,"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0624.wav, bugging them what have you been doing they've had it longer than i had
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0625.wav," did they know you were dealing with this? And she'd be like, yep, yep."
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0626.wav," willing to say, oh, this is what I'm going through in this area."
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0627.wav," over the edge. Like I said, in certain situations, if I see it,"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0628.wav," But is that something your dad's giving you, your parents give you?"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0629.wav," not done before, but it's definitely more out of my comfort zone in terms of just being very"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0630.wav," for a girl to look like that, but it just, sex in real life does not"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0631.wav," And like we spent the whole night just drinking, having food, talking."
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0632.wav," even though I don't hear you or see you, I know you are there."
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0633.wav," of them and they're not killing them. I mean, it's age-old things that have gone on throughout history that..."
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0634.wav," how about you? And as I put myself out there,"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0635.wav, there's quite a divide between that Caribbean side and the African side. I think for
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0636.wav," to talk to people that look like you, sound like you, walk like you to really understand"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0637.wav," episode, but something that has always kind of stuck in my mind is I don't want to be independent of my partner and I don't want to be dependent on my partner."
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0638.wav," partner, why were they not able to assess the character then? And then halfway in their lifetime they've divorced someone."
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0639.wav, like yeah just and reach out to artists you want to be with artists
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0640.wav, culture forces you into a barrier where this is the same way it forces men to do this and
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0641.wav," There's so many layers to it and it's not a thing that like,"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0642.wav," Yes, we have to fight the battle of racism coming in from other places,"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0643.wav," I listed like 20 movies and I was like,"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0644.wav," It's kind of new to us. So we're kind of accepting sucks. If we're honest, like you don't see a lot of older black guys in the city."
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0645.wav," Yeah, I think for me, that was, it was the first time I ever kind of, like you said, and that was going to be one of my questions, kind of let myself go without thinking"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0646.wav, was just that's literally all it was about and thank God
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0647.wav," you know, outside of kind of doing"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0648.wav," mind, let's go for like, he was going to cook me food."
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0649.wav," Yeah. And I think, you know, it's incredible because you think in this day and age,"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0650.wav," but maybe not in the sense that we see on TV, but definitely some sort of"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0651.wav, stay in it and like throw in um
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0652.wav, but they really didn't like him and I think it was
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0653.wav," Sometimes it is just hard. Sometimes things go wrong and actually, you know, resource and money is not necessarily going to get you out of that situation."
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0654.wav, we'll check in again to see how things have progressed at Mechanism Labs and some of the cool work you guys
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0655.wav, it means you just have a lot more excitement from all angles.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0656.wav," Well, we're not able to create content that, you know, we want to."
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0657.wav, that may not actually come to pass because either they're too risky or something around the business model is wrong or something around the technology is wrong.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0658.wav, for everyone. I think right now there's a huge opening for being able to figure out signal in the space in that there's a ton of different projects going on.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0659.wav, really funny way. The white paper is fantastic. And I think that this thing has actually raised a significant amount of money.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0660.wav," important project. Nowadays, there's probably, what, 5x, 10x,"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0661.wav, just in the interest in the platform and the type of creators that want to start.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0662.wav, we're broaching the subject. This is exactly the problem with financial intermediaries and with centrally controlled money.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0663.wav," So I think that this is the up and coming. And I think that from a legal perspective, how we started"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0664.wav, So we might not make it that you have to participate in every
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0665.wav, the paywalls that are in place.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0666.wav," and that we're seeing kind of in similar lights. And to some of us in the space,"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0667.wav," I mean, you can see creators coming into the space now, a lot of technical people who hadn't necessarily thought of this now becoming very interested."
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0668.wav, The effect of this is to persecute already marginalized groups like trans men and women
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0669.wav, even though Patreon got its following and it blew up because queer performers and people of color were using that platform to host their content.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0670.wav, it perpetuates the stigma that we already have surrounding women's bodies.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0671.wav, Because typically we're the first industry to push forward.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0672.wav, So the fact that we have to hide something so natural is...
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0673.wav," I think it's do the best you can, find resources that work for you."
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0674.wav," I have a large role in engineering, whole space in, uh,"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0675.wav, diversity and inclusivity are one of the most important things we need to think about in terms of engineering.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0676.wav, I would really like to foster a mindset within Waterloo Engineering
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0677.wav, newly launched hashtag Take That Step campaign is promoting steps anyone can take for improving mental well-being.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0678.wav," much, Pamela. I'm so excited to be back at the University of Waterloo."
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0679.wav," to live phone, video, or text counseling."
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0680.wav, I feel personally sad that our first years can't come onto campus and do the kinds of things you do as engineers and which are some of the biggest traditions
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0681.wav," But then we also have, if you want to jump ahead into what the myths are around COVID-19, then you can just play the bonus round, which will"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0682.wav, to make sure the first years have some form of an experience that's kind of cool and unique.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0683.wav, just tapping into it and creating pathways for them to showcase what those opportunities are. And then telling them right from the beginning to kind of be looking out for
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0684.wav," And while we're on the subject of students, last week..."
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0685.wav, despite decades of work. And so I felt compelled to say yes.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0686.wav," I take all my information from the government and all these research articles that you can find. So it's more so like if you don't believe me, you can"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0687.wav," The teacher has said, today, this is a topic we're covering."
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0688.wav, that adult audiences are also enjoying games on their handheld devices a lot.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0689.wav, It's not acceptable that a group of our people don't have clean water and that every person in Canada has a right to clean water in their community.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0690.wav," Well, as you know, there was already a lot of uncertainty around COVID-19, and I think people, when they add misinformation into the mix of such uncertainty, it just has very"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0691.wav," And just like every week, we'll talk about some of the top stories featured in the Daily Bulletin and look ahead to what's on the horizon both inside and"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0692.wav, and then one of the adults gets COVID in the family and has significant medical health complications
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0693.wav, We have a contingency bursary with a budget that is
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0694.wav," something that's just bothersome. If it's not about geese, because I can't control the geese as much as I'd like to."
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0695.wav, They do texting. So you go to log in with your password.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0696.wav," who will tell us how the University of Waterloo is staying one step, or maybe two steps, ahead of those black hats who want to hack the planet."
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0697.wav, Because online security is an even bigger issue now than it was back in 1995.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0698.wav," Other films out that year, it was crazy."
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0699.wav," that must mean that I'm bad because in society, and you know,"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0700.wav, well over 120 times in the last couple of weeks.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0701.wav," For the first time, international students can attend the, well,"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0702.wav," school children, the decision about choosing between online and in-person delivery for school children is up to the parents right now."
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0703.wav," Oh dear. Well, it's not just the students who are back."
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0704.wav," You know, that is the second time in as many days that I've heard someone refer to their person as a brand."
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0705.wav," Actually, Brandon, I loved it when you would tell us things about the campus or the university that we didn't know."
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0706.wav, based also on the rights of indigenous people as defined by the United Nations.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0707.wav, I'm hoping that there'll be fewer aches and pains among our colleagues now that we've shared this information.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0708.wav," The campus environment will continue to evolve to support learning,"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0709.wav," And in many cases, courts have ruled in favor of the indigenous interpretation of those treaties."
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0710.wav, She spoke with Pamela about things we can all do to protect and improve our personal finances during the pandemic.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0711.wav," but even if you're in mathematics or computer science or wherever you are,"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0712.wav, He pioneered the systems concept and development of engineering technology for managing networks of paved roads.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0713.wav, you're going to have that back pain through the shoulder blades.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0714.wav, for the virus and then at that time you can still infect people.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0715.wav, That's right. The Haldeman tract was promised to the Six Nations
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0716.wav," here in Canada, I would say Britain and France were"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0717.wav, So you have to be clear in terms of explaining to people what are the risks and benefits on joining
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0718.wav, They're single. They live alone. And they have nine other friends who are single and live alone.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0719.wav, Another advantage of social bubbling social circles is that the contact tracing is easier.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0720.wav," which was just a low, cruel plane without"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0721.wav, And I never want to think about any of it.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0722.wav, no matter how deeply they may have buried my broken corpse in Mexico.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0723.wav, I was teaching at Genesee Community College and she was a student.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0724.wav, It even had blue shutters and a blue door.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0725.wav," He was reciting a passage from, I don't know what part of the Bible."
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0726.wav, I asked him to meet me in a couple days when his throat was a little better.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0727.wav, stalking fiend practicing his movements in the dark before picking his first victim.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0728.wav," Without knowing even more, like whether they're good or malevolent?"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0729.wav," maneuvered out of it, she became unhinged."
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0730.wav, I would wake up and look at the ceiling
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0731.wav," Nung said, smiling and pointing to his brother."
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0732.wav, The guilt I felt over that was terrible.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0733.wav," Not interested at all in what was going on around him,"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0734.wav, measure not of the number of passengers who embarked but
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0735.wav, think he could be dangerous.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0736.wav, I sat back down on my bed because I was afraid to keep looking.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0737.wav," God, it's beyond the imagination."
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0738.wav," But really, I would say that she was the most devoted parishioner"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0739.wav, I was not ready for death itself.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0740.wav, I was scared to even get closer to the window. It was
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0741.wav, and her voice when she described her terror.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0742.wav," I'm going to church, finally."
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0743.wav, I was afraid. I was finally afraid to be around him.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0744.wav, The letters were incredibly angry and threatening.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0745.wav, There was nothing else in existence with the victim's blood on it that could be connected to Mr. Engel.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0746.wav, Which I think is what he wanted anyway.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0747.wav, It didn't feel right. It didn't seem to me to be the way the state would go about things.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0748.wav, He had never given me a card or any contact information.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0749.wav, It's not trying to fill jobs that existed before the pandemic.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0750.wav, but sometimes he'd be lying there smoking
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0751.wav, We have to look at the evidence to see what the numbers are.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0752.wav, I told him at some point I didn't even belong in the house.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0753.wav," On the one hand, we can't keep the economy close forever."
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0754.wav," aware, but it is a challenge really to"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0755.wav, Those numbers we saw are probably not gonna get too much worse.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0756.wav, Don't say a word. On the Saturday I ran away...
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0757.wav, That was the hope. They're estimating in the US.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0758.wav," Well, so it's not even if they don't want them."
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0759.wav, I didn't know him that well.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0760.wav, you can earn a lot of money at home without going back to work.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0761.wav, He kept wanting to know who was to blame for it.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0762.wav, Nobody was to blame. I told him about how I lied to get out of jail early.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0763.wav, that was like another sign from God.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0764.wav," we're seeing more job creation. And some of these are in areas that, you know, they're growing employment."
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0765.wav," maybe they're immunocompromised. And the third is that we're hearing more about, and some people from"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0766.wav, It's all locked up with bulletproof glass and special ceilings that nobody could ever climb into the ceiling.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0767.wav," This is really tragic for a lot of people and the scariest bit is,"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0768.wav, I started crying as soon as she picked up.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0769.wav," And once in a while, these efforts to get data work, and sometimes you get a wall put in front of you and it just not gonna go anywhere."
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0770.wav," I thought, God is looking out for me."
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0771.wav, there's no family identifier that I can link them.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0772.wav, I was so relieved. Someone must have spotted me.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0773.wav," Canada, that's 40% of three to five million people are not going back to the job. So"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0774.wav, can't believe what's happened to their sales.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0775.wav, But what appears to be happening is the pause has been on so long that it's actually affecting people's consumption behavior.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0776.wav," but it's just unbelievable. I showed it to my dad this morning and it's,"
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0777.wav," she had vanished, she'd gone into the woods as if she were afraid of me or something."
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0778.wav, I barely had time to feel my heart begin to pound furiously in my chest when something more terrifying came.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0779.wav, She's moving. He was on Haven Avenue
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0780.wav, picked out a man standing on the shoulder.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0781.wav," It was a cabin, the smallest one I'd ever seen."
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0782.wav, and I can't believe that everything that happened with it happened within seven days.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0783.wav, nine years. Can it be?
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0784.wav, I discovered that there was like $100 missing from a
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0785.wav, Look over that field over there. It's really sticking.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0786.wav, Nothing I could do but wait and hope it wouldn't get any worse.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0787.wav," other cars in view, but it was a full 20 minutes and I was in a truck stop surrounded by people before I felt safe."
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0788.wav, the whole thing started to seem more absurd.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0789.wav, from a low-hanging branch. I kept going and then I finally saw something
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0790.wav, freakishly specific crimes and minor disasters.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0791.wav, pine needles and grime and dirt.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0792.wav, a little interesting. A very good little sketch of a woman's face in profile.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0793.wav, silence felt like it was safer.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0794.wav, of those faces. I got a bit of a shock.
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0795.wav, more than my time. So
MSP-PODCAST_test3_0796.wav," person, this medicine person is probably not going to say, oh, I won't help your child unless you give me this much."
